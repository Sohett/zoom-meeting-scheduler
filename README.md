Doc: https://thomassohet.notion.site/Technical-Challenge-674a66b9a25845938dcac1a4df4a3df3

→ `back`: a simple `Node.js` app created in the [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) style (deployed on AWS lambda). In `dev` env, it can be run via express to provide a local server.

→ `front`: a simple `Vue.js` app using the power of a nice open source project: [FullCalendar](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar). This frontend app provides an interface to the client as a calendar in order to book a Zoom meeting with the owner of the `efounders.challenge@gmail.com` Zoom account.

 ⇨ Project can be tested [here](https://preeminent-lokum-b2816b.netlify.app/) (frontend deployed via Netlify)
